    <p class="cap1">Traditional corn cake</p>
    <p class="cap2">Enjoy the taste of fat from the soft cream layer mixed with the aroma of corn with delicious soft corn cake.<br>
        Corn cream cake is made from fresh milk cream, inside is a layer of soft and fragrant gato cake mixed with a layer of soft cream, the fatty and chewy aroma of corn... making people not feel bored.<br>
        Cake processing ingredients are carefully selected, absolutely no preservatives are used, ensuring safety for the health of diners.
        A team of skilled bakers with skilled hands and exquisite taste give you a wonderful taste experience.</p>

    <p class="cap1">Cheese cream cake</p>
    <p class="cap2">In addition to birthday cake, salted egg sponge cake is also a unique feature in birthdays, longevity or simply a dessert in a family meal.
        The soft and sweet crust mixed with the salty taste of salted eggs and greasy cheese makes every heart melt.</p>

    <p class="cap1">Ice cream cake</p>
    <p class="cap2">This cake line is quite new and extremely unique. Instead of the usual gato cake, the ingredient of this cake line is the cold cream that we still enjoy. The cream is poured into a cake mold, put in the freezer to solidify, separate and put the thin layers together and decorate into a large cake.
        Because the main ingredient is cold cream, this cake line will be more suitable for birthday parties in rooms with air conditioning on.</p>

    <p class="cap1">Tiramisu</p>
    <p class="cap2">Originating in Italy, tiramisu has quickly become a staple for birthday parties in recent years. The impression of tiramisu is that the cake is soft and fluffy, imbued with the flavors of rum and coffee, while the cream that is spread is always greasy but not boring. If you love the rich aroma of a blend of light wine, espresso, biscuits, eggs and cheese, never miss a piece of tiramisu. Just a small spoon, it all melts in your mouth in no time.
        Tiramisu is also special in that it can be made without an oven, without a whisk. Also, tiramisu has been constantly changing its recipe throughout the years. If in the past the tiramisu layers were made separately, today, people have begun to use mascarpone cheese to create adhesion on each layer of cake. The cake in the middle can also be a biscuit or a cake. And similarly the powder sprinkled on the cake can also be replaced, from cocoa powder to coconut powder and green tea powder.

    <p class="cap1">Flan</p>
    <p class="cap2">Flan is a type of cake that carries a gentle and very artistic flair that is said to be very typical of France. The cake is basically made from egg yolks, milk, sugar and caramel. From the day it was introduced into our country, this flan has gradually become one of the most popular and extremely nutritious snacks in the cafe.</p>
